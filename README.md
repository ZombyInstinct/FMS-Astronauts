This game was created for my FSE 100 class at ASU. The goal was to develop a program for stroke patients that were relearning fine motor skills (FMS). The requirements involved many feedback loops such as audio or visual cues. Additionally, the games take advantage of keyboard and mouse movement to help promote hand-eye coordination by tracking and timing.
